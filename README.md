# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of the analysis is to assist Louise, an emerging playwriter who wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to get her play “Fever” made. She would like to know if there are precise aspects to make a project successful. We will filter through crowdfunding data to determine if there are any correlations with the success of a play. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
After carefully sorting through the crowdfunding data, with an emphasis to her specific area of theater, we were able to ensure the most relevant information to Louise was presented. It was determined that the most successful period was from the month of May to July, with an average of 99 plays. There does not appear to be a strong correlation with the failed plays.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
63.5% of all plays had a goal of under $10,000 which was derived from the grouping of 3 goal ranges out of 12 total.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I have had many years of experience with using Excel, and to me it was very straightforward with understanding the logic. I did make mistakes by being overconfident and trying to quickly go through it all. I restarted and did everything step by step to ensure I get the exact outcomes required. I will take that approach going forward with future challenges. The instructions are generally very clear and direct. A challenge for me was navigating Github and using the MD files at first. It is completely new to me and I will continue to learn how to improve my knowledge on these platforms. 

## Results

### - What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
There is a clear correlation that the months from May to July had a noticeable spike in successful start dates, which was highlighted in the pivot table and the line chart. The failed campaigns averaged about 41 per month and the aforementioned spike was minimally impacted with the number of failures.

### - What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The 2 combined ranged of $4,999 and less had the largest success rate. The budget range for Louise was 48%. 
### - What are some limitations of this dataset?

The limitations on this dataset are we do not know what methods were used to facilitate the fundraisers. Was there a marketing budget and how does that correlate? That could be a variable on how successful a campaign is.

### - What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Another possible table and graph that can be used is about the length of the campaigns and if there is a strong correlation with the time from the start to finish of the campaign, and average daily dollar value to put it into perspective.
